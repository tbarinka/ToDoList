I have created a filter "filterTaskstoList(string)" to fill an array with
tasks that belong to a certain list represented by "string"

I need to rework the functions on mainDOM.js, roughly so that by invoking:
        mainDOMLoad(listTitle)
performs the following work:
        1. run filterTaskstoList(listTitle) to return an array of tasks
        2. Generate DOM elements on main containing the items in the array
